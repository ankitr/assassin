            <h1>Spork</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the annual Gunn Spork competition website. Inspired by <a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/assassins/">the Cambridge Assassins' Guild</a>, Spork is a live-action game of espionage, stealth, and strategy.</p>
            <p>The purpose of the game is to eliminate your target with a variety of tools, from the traditional spork to 'poisoned' water bottles, while avoiding being eliminated yourself. The game starts off large, often with hundreds of people, but soon narrows down to a group of master competitors. The first game begins Monday, September 8, 2014. For more information, read the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> or <a href="#rules">Rules</a>, or contact the <a href="mailto:team@gunnapps.com">gamemasters</a>.</p>

            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <h3>What really is this?</h3>
            <p>Spork is a school-wide game where students use sporks and other tools to eliminate other players. It's intended as a fun, social opportunity for community-level competition. Games can last from a couple of hours to a couple months, depending on the size of the game and the competency of the players. Most games are somewhere in between.</p>
            <h3>Who's behind this?</h3>
            <p>The idea stemmed from the <a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/assassins/">Cambridge Assassins' Guild</a>. The Gunn Faction is run by Ankit Ranjan and Kartik Chandra.</p>
            <h3>What does it take to play?</h3>
            <p>The game is free of cost, but takes some time and dedication. Some competitors will be more devoted than others, but it doesn't take much more than sportsmanship and a will to have fun to play. You can forget about the game for days at a time if desired, but just remember that letting your guard down leaves you open to attack.</p>
            <h3>How do you eliminate players?</h3>
            <p>Specifics are provided in the rules, but it’s primarily through the use of labeled tools. Some of the more common ones are sporks (and spoons), but creativity allows anything from ‘poisoned’ doorknobs to ‘refrigerator’ cardboard boxes thrown from rooftops. Discretion is left up to the gamemaster as to what’s permitted and what isn’t.</p>
            <h3>What happens when you eliminate someone?</h3>
            <p>After the euphoria of a well-executed elimination wears off, you both inform the gamemaster, and the victim’s target is now assigned to you. In the event of a dispute, all related parties will be brought for discussion with the gamemaster.</p>
            <h3>What happens when you're eliminated?</h3>
            <p>Depending on how glorious your elimination, you may go on to be sung of in legend for coming years. Regardless, this usually involves sending an account of your elimination to the gamemaster and informing your assassin of their next target (your target before elimination). Depending on the gamemaster, you may be permitted to assist in other elimination attempts.</p>

                            <p>You are permitted to use unarmed accomplices in your elimination attempts. You are <em>encouraged</em> to have witnesses—they help resolve disagreements, but more importantly, add entertainment.</p>
                        </li>

                            <h3>Disputes and Ceasefires</h3>
                            <p>The gamemaster is at complete liberty to call a ceasefire and determine the outcome of an elimination attempt in the event of any disputes. The result of such negotiations are at the gamemaster's discretion, and their word is final.</p>

                    <h2>Area of Play</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Out of Bounds</h3>
                            <p>Many off-campus locations are in-game, and elimination attempts can be made both in and out of school. However, in the spirit of sanity and respect for others, certain areas are regarded as <strong>Out of Bounds</strong> (OOB) and are not legal for fair play. If in doubt, consider whether any elimination attempts in the area would be dangerous or disrespectful. Some OOB areas:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Any classroom, regardless of whether or not class is in session.</li>
                                <li>Theaters, offices, and libraries.</li>
                                <li>Public buildings of all kinds, including religious buildings.</li>
                                <li>Anyone under employ is OOB while at work.</li>
                                <li>Dances (and the lines to go in) are considered off limits. The areas surrounding, however, are fair game.</li>
                                <li>Lunch lines are in bounds for non-projectile weapons.</li>
                                <li>Organized sports activities are OOB. Pick up games are in bounds.</li>
                                <li>Any participant operating a vehicle is OOB. Passengers are in bounds, unless attacking said party may pose risk to the vehicle’s occupants.</li>
                                <li>Public transportation is OOB.</li>
                                <li>Class hours are out of bounds, unless both you <em>and</em> your target have preps. Passing periods are also out of bounds. Lunch and brunch are <em>not</em> out of bounds.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Escape</h3>
                            <p>OOB regions may not be use to escape elimination unless the attacked party has prior obligations at that area.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Tools</h2>
                    <p>All weapons must be clearly labeled with what they are. The following weapons are allowed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tableware:</strong> Spoons, forks, and sporks can be used to eliminate your target. Contact with your target qualifies as elimination</li>
                        <li><strong>Poison:</strong> ‘Poisons’ may be planted in the target’s lunch, P.E. locker, backpack, etc. The target dies when they find the poison. Poison is applied by taping a large ‘Poison’ label to the item.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you have ideas for a novel type of weapon, run them by the gamemaster. Most of the time, as long as they aren't potentially harmful and not overpowered, it'll be a yes.</p>
                </li>
